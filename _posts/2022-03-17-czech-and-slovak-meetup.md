I had a great time last Saturday meeting an inspirational and motivated #community of Slovak and Czech expats in Switzerland, where I was invited as a speaker.

We discussed the specifics of expat Life in Switzerland, challenges upon arrival and during integration, as well as how each of us can (and should also try to) make world a better place. Tomáš Petrek shared his inspirational story of coming back to Slovakia to start a great business project. Olga Křičková about mastering the hardships upon her arrival to Switzerland, work in a pharmaceutical company and personal development.

The topic also came to the sad reality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Thanks Slovak and Czech Scientific MeetUp, Zurich (Vědecké setkání Čechů a Slováků v Curychu) for organising this Meet up and inviting me as a speaker, thanks Tomáš Petrek and Olga Křičková and Petr Svoboda and all the other participants for a great discussion and looking forward to meeting you all once again.
