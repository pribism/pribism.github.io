After hours of learning basics css and html on [codecademy](http://codecademy.org/) and on the internet I finally put together the basic scaffold of my website, which I hope to make better and better by making small contributions when I'll have time or urge to do something different from biology.  

However, tomorrow starts a new semester, which I'm quite looking forward to. I hope both, the school and the research project will be interesting and demanding, just like they were during the last semester (if not even more). Looking forward to dive more deeply into the fields of physiology, biochemistry, newly microbiology and, as usual, genetics.
